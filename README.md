In this project, we developed a Movie Recommendation System using a content-based filtering approach, which suggests movies based on their similarity to a given input movie. The dataset contained key attributes such as title, genres, keywords, cast, and crew, which were preprocessed to extract meaningful features. We handled missing values, removed duplicates, and transformed structured JSON-like columns into lists to ensure data integrity. Since textual data plays a crucial role in content-based recommendations, we applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization and stemming to normalize the text. Additionally, we used TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to quantify text-based features and cosine similarity to measure the closeness between movies, allowing us to generate relevant recommendations.

The system effectively suggests movies based on their content, making it particularly useful for first-time users who lack viewing history. However, a content-based approach has limitations, such as its inability to consider user preferences or ratings. To enhance accuracy, we can integrate collaborative filtering, which recommends movies based on user behavior, or build hybrid models that combine both content and user-based approaches
